# Forgotten Realms: Unlimted Adventures

This is a source recreation of the original video game released on March 17, 1993, by Strategic Simulations Inc. The original game was released for the IBM PC and Apple Macintosh. Forgotten Realms: Unlimited Adventures, also known as Unlimited Adventures, or by the acronyms FRUA or UA.

This recreation is true to the original version complete with 100% feature set, 100% compatiblity with modules created with the original game construction kit, and a new plug-in system to completely rebuild original "Gold Box" games with your own versions including graphics, gameplay, rulesets, sounds, and more.

## Background

The FRUA community as it's come to be known as, has been actively thriving since the late 1990's with people building all sorts of modules for the original game. The community, which I've been a member of since then, also has created a fairly extensive set of hacks, which allowed the designer to change things not normally changable in the original game and overcome some issues with the original executable.

The original executeable, CKIT.EXE, along with it's supporting files is long gone. Only binaries remain and will run faithfully under tools like DOSBox without issue.

The problem comes in that a) the system is DOS based and limited in scope, capabilities, and design and b) the system is DOS based. While I love DOS as much as the next person, it has its limitations.

## Rebuilding

The dust settled and a few of use in the early 90s set out to build a better FRUA, a bigger, better FRUA. My own project, UAF (Unlimited Adventures Forever) eventually became UAWin (abandoning the multiplatform) and eventually fizzled out due to time constaints and stupid acts of reformatting hard drives without backups. Another project, Dungeon Craft, rose up to the challenge and is alive and well today at http://uaf.sourceforge.net/

## The New Era

Skip ahead to the 2000s and a bright eyed, bushy tailed programmer set out to conquer a new mountain. To find the original source code to UA and get it released. This led that lad down a deep and dark path, frought with danger and disappointment. In the end, the mighty Wizards of the Coast prevailed with the response "We're not sure where the source code assets are anymore and have no interest in pursuing them, now, or in the future".

## Today

Today is a new day and the journey begins here...
